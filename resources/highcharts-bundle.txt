We Bleed Highcharts bundle for https://heartbleed.michalspacek.cz/

This is the list of things you want to include in the
Highcharts bundle when using the builder at http://www.highcharts.com/download/

You won't need this list unless you want to build a website similar to mine.

- jQuery adapter
- Plotlines or bands
- Datetime axis
- Logarithmic axis
- Tooltip
- Touch
- MS touch
- Area
- Exporting (requires CSP form-action https://export.highcharts.com when fallbackToExportServer is enabled, which by default is)
- Offline exporting (requires CSP img-src 'blob:')

When your site is accessible via HTTPS don't forget to change exporting.url, by default it points to HTTP server and that throws mixed content warnings.
